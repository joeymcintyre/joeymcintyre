## Joey McIntyre

Hi! 👋 I’m a third-year Electrical Engineering student at McMaster University with a passion for embedded systems, circuit design, and creative problem-solving. I enjoy tackling challenging technical projects, whether that means building hardware prototypes, writing efficient firmware, or developing clean and practical software solutions.

When I’m not in the lab or working on projects, you’ll probably find me training with McMaster’s Varsity Cross-Country & Track team 🏃. Balancing athletics and engineering has taught me discipline, time management, and the value of teamwork.

I’m always looking for opportunities to apply my skills in real-world projects and contribute to innovative engineering solutions.

📂 Highlighted Projects:

- 🛰️ 3D Spatial Mapping System (COMPENG 2DX3 Final Project)
 - Embedded system using a VL53L1X Time-of-Flight sensor, stepper motor, and MSP432 ARM Cortex-M4F to generate indoor 3D maps. Data sent over UART and visualized in Python/Open3D.

- 🐍 Snake Game (COMPENG 2SH4 Project)
 - Classic snake game built in C++ with object-oriented design. Implemented custom data structures (objPos, objPosArrayList) and finite state machine (FSM) logic for gameplay.

- 🎮 Programming Project Assignments (COMPENG 2SH4 – PPA1, PPA2, PPA3)

 - PPA1: Marquee display with rolling ASCII animation and asynchronous input.

 - PPA2: 20×10 ASCII game board with WASD-controlled player and FSM movement.

 - PPA3: Scavenger hunt word game with random placement, collisions, and memory-safe object management.

- ⚡ 3-Bit DAC (ELECENG 2EI4 Project)
 - Designed, simulated, and built a 3-bit digital-to-analog converter with VFS = 5V. Measured gain error, offset error, and differential non-linearity.

- 🔐 CMOS XOR Gate (ELECENG 2EI4 Project)
 - Built a 12-transistor CMOS XOR gate using CD4007 ICs. Completed full schematic-to-pin mapping, verified functionality with the Analog Discovery 3.

- 🔌 DC Power Supply (ELECENG 2EI4 Project)
 - Designed a regulated 3.0 V ± 0.1 V power supply from a 120 V AC source. Included transformer design, rectification, filtering, and regulation stages.

- ⚙️ Ideal Voltage-Controlled Switches (ELECENG 2EI4 Project)
 - Implemented and analyzed Type-1 and Type-2 MOSFET-based ideal switches, comparing simulated and measured performance.
