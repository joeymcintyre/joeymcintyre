## Joey McIntyre

Hi! 👋 I’m a third-year Electrical Engineering student at McMaster University with a passion for embedded systems, circuit design, and creative problem-solving. I enjoy tackling challenging technical projects, whether that means building hardware prototypes, writing efficient firmware, or developing clean and practical software solutions.

When I’m not in the lab or working on projects, you’ll probably find me training with McMaster’s Varsity Cross-Country & Track team 🏃. Balancing athletics and engineering has taught me discipline, time management, and the value of teamwork.

I’m always looking for opportunities to apply my skills in real-world projects and contribute to innovative engineering solutions.

✨ Currently looking for Summer 2025 Internships!
